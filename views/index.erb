<p>
	Welcome to the website for Scrabbli, a new, short project by a few
	<a href="http://sse.se.rit.edu">SSE</a> members and alums.
</p>

<h2>About Scrabbli</h2>
<p>
	Scrabbli is a simple contest where the participants create a scrabble solver
	that given their hand and the current state of the board, return the best next move (i.e.
	highest scoring word)
</p>
<p>
	To make coding more fun, everyone participating will be writing their
	solutions in different languages (for the most part).
</p>
<h2>Scrabbli Redux</h2>
<p>
So none of us completed our scrabble solvers the first time around. So we've decided to bring it back.
Starting this summer begins the scrabbli redux where hopefully we can all finish what we've started.
 Same rules apply. No limits on languages anymore and you can start over in a completely new language
 if you would like.  Whatever floats your boat. The skys are the limit. We are welcoming new participants
 as well.
